mouse-click-switch
==================

a system try app to easily switch mouse buttons to left or right handed

Why write this?
===============
While pairing with fellow devs, turns out that we sometimes have a different preference of whether we use the mouse with our left hand, or right hand.
Because I'm lazy, switching the mouse button configuration via the control panel became a drag, hence this handy little app that does it for you with a single click!

How to use it
=============
When the app is running, a "handy" icon will appear in your system tray, showing you if your mouse is set up to be left-handed or right-handed.

You can either:
- click this icon with your primary mouse button to switch your buttons
- click this icon with your secondary mouse button to bring up a menu, allowing you to switch your buttons or exit the app
